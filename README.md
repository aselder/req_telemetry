# ReqTelemetry

A `Req` plugin to instrument requests with `:telemetry` events.

## Installation

`req_telemetry` is not yet available through Hex. In the meantime, you can install
it by adding the repository directly:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:req_telemetry, github: "zachallaun/req_telemetry"}
  ]
end
```
